The following was copied from the Kaggle data description: 

_"The training dataset consists of approximately 145k time series. Each of these time series represent a number of daily views of a different Wikipedia article, starting from July, 1st, 2015 up until December 31st, 2016. The leaderboard during the training stage is based on traffic from January, 1st, 2017 up until March 1st, 2017.

The second stage will use training data up until September 1st, 2017. The final ranking of the competition will be based on predictions of daily views between September 13th, 2017 and November 13th, 2017 for each article in the dataset. You will submit your forecasts for these dates by September 12th."_
